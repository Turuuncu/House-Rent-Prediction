# Machine Learning Project: Regression and Clustering

This project is a regression and clustering study using machine learning algorithms. Below are the algorithms and metrics used:

- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Extra Trees Regressor**
- **Linear Regression**
- **KMeans Clustering**
- **XGBoost Regressor**

In this project, the analysis and model results on the dataset are examined in detail. You can visit our repo for code samples and more information.
